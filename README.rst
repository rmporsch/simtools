simtools
-----------

The aim of this project is to provide a comprehensive simulation framework to generate complex inter-related phenotypes.

Currently the package provides function and classes to:

- simulate categorical and continues phenotypes
- simulate multiple phenotypes with causal, genetic, and environmental inter-relatedness
- provides a connection to plink to perform various tasks (such as GWAS, clumpling, etc.)
- a number of additional tools to perform various tasks on summary statistics
- some limited plotting functions

Documentation is available [here](http://simtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
