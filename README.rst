Genetic Simulation Tools (GST)
==========================================

When developing new methods it is often easier to start with some simulated data.
Here I provide some tools to simulate various phenotypes from imported or artificial genetic data.

Currently the library provides function and classes to:

- simulate categorical and continues phenotypes
- simulate multiple phenotypes with causal, genetic, and environmental inter-relatedness
- provides a connection to plink to perform various tasks (such as GWAS, clumpling, etc.)
- some limited plotting functions

Documentation is available at http://simtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.

Installation
----------------

.. code:: bash

    git clone git@github.com:rmporsch/simtools.git
    cd simtools
    python setup.py
