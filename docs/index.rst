Genetic Simulation Tools
====================================


Usage:
=========

`simtools` is separated into three main modules.
The `genotypes` module helps to import from Plink and VCF files as well as is able to simulate genotype matrices.
The core `simtools` module on the other hand supports various phenotype simulations.
This includes simple continuous and binary phenotypes as well as more complicated inter-related phenotypes.
At last, the `tools` module contains various functions to make your life a bit easier (such as the computation of GWASs, Genomic Inflation Factor, as well as others).
